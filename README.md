### Keep track of your Yu-Gi-Oh collection online at [DeckVault.xyz](https://deckvault.xyz)

<img src='/public/images/landingPage.png'><br><br>

####This project began as a personal way to organize and filter through my personal collection that spans over 900 cards. The goal is to keep track of what I currently have and how many copies of each one I have. This was done during my spring semester in school for a class project. The goal of this web-app is to give the user the ablilty to search up Yu-Gi-Oh cards throught the official [Yu-Gi-Oh API](https://ygoprodeck.com/api-guide/).

- Adding cards to collection
- Creating multiple seperate collection sets
- Create decks with the standard 40-60 card limit
- Set up an avatar for your profile

##Technologies
####This project was made with technologies brand new to me, so implementation might not be the best. These include: 
- NextJS (react framework)
- ChakraUI (UI library)
- Supabase (database)
- Vercel (deployment)

<hr>
##Features
####The features might change from the original deployment due to a reworking of the database:
- Card search (punctuation not necessary for search results)
-- fuzzy search (enter word and find cards that contain input in their title)
-- complete name (find a card using complete name)
- Account registration/login
-- email verification 
-- password recovery
- Card zoom modals

##Future implementations
- Fix collection functionality
- Create deck functionality
- Account dashboard to add/edit/delete any collection deck
- Add cards to collection from zoom modals

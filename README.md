<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<img src="/public/images/homePage.png" />

This project focuses on using the [Official Yu-Gi-Oh API](https://ygoprodeck.com/api-guide/) to let users search for their favorite cards. With an account, uses have access to more features with the main one being the ability to create a Collection to store and organize their cards digitally. This was built with [Next JS](https://nextjs.org) and [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com) for the front-end and [Supabase](https://supabase.com) as the database. Hosting is done with [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

## Roadmap
Additional features and issues that are in the works include:
- Adding card prices for cards from selected vendors (eBay, Tcgplayer, Amazon, CoolStuffInc).
- Search query function to search through your collections for instead of scrolling to find a card.
- Filtering functionality: filter your search results (attribute, race, level, type. etc)
- Enhanced customization for your collections (edit name, add a preview card color, more detailed data of the collection)
- Update the collection page for an easier experience searching/adding cards in the collection page.
- deck support for collections

See the [open issues](https://github.com/jegioma/Deck_Vault/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
